      <h1>AI Fairness and Law Project</h1>
      <h2>Using AI to Increase Fairness by Improving Access to Justice</h2>
      <p>This project seek to increase social fairness by using AI to improve public access to justice. </p>
      Many AI tools are already streamlining legal workflows, however, such tools do not reach members of 
        the public and legal service practitioners except through a commercial paywall that prohibits many 
        from accessing them. As a result, these tools are usually available only to a very select few who 
        can afford them.</p>
      <p>In FAI project, we leverage the recent advances in machine learng, natural language processing(NLP), legal argument modeling, computational statutory interpretation that enpowers users 
        to access high quality legal information with much lower cost.</p>
